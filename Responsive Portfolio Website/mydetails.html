       <p>As a dedicated and versatile full-stack web developer, I've honed my expertise across a wide spectrum of programming languages and technologies. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and proficiency in the MERN stack, I have consistently demonstrated the ability to create dynamic, user-friendly websites and web applications.</p>
       <br>
       <p>My most notable accomplishment is the development of indeekos.com, a live project that serves as a testament to my skill and creativity. This cosmetic brand website showcases my ability to craft compelling digital experiences and engage users with cutting-edge design and functionality.</p>

       <p>My journey in technology began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering from NIST Berhampur, where I acquired a solid academic foundation and a deep understanding of computer science principles.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Currently, I am in the midst of an exciting and intellectually rewarding internship where I am actively involved in creating an assessment portal. This project not only challenges me to push the boundaries of my technical capabilities but also highlights my dedication to practical, real-world solutions.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Hailing from the scenic town of Bhanjanagar in Ganjam, Odisha, I am currently based in the vibrant city of Bhubaneswar. This dynamic urban environment has been instrumental in shaping my career as a web developer.</p>
       <br>
       <p>With a passion for problem-solving and a commitment to staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends, I am continually expanding my knowledge and skillset to ensure that I deliver the most efficient and elegant solutions to the projects I undertake. My journey as a full-stack web developer is a testament to my dedication to excellence in web development and my unceasing drive to push the boundaries of what's possible in the digital realm.</p>
